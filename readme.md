LCTLoadTracker is an app to assist me eventually with tracking applicants, employees, owners, customers, loads, mileage and payroll.



Project Requirements:

        application.
            - Created Person Class 
                - Controller created multiple objects of the Person class for             
                    create, edit, and delete.
                - List of Person returned within the application.


    - 3 Functions or Methods
        - Within in the controller when the Person tab is accessed and the Person data is 
            returned in teh list the Index function is returned using _context to return the list of Person.  Values returned include the Person data.
